    <h1>Microfrontend Integration in Nuxt 3</h1>
    
    <p>
      This project demonstrates a modular architecture using micro frontends, enabling the development and deployment 
      of distinct applications that are seamlessly integrated into a central base application. 
      The architecture promotes scalability, code reusability, and separation of concerns.
